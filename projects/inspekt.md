  Frontend developers who lose time mapping what they see in the browser back to

## From an element to its source

Use Ctrl+Alt+Click on an instrumented element to reveal the file, line, and column behind it. Read the surrounding source, copy its location, or open it in your configured editor.

## Keep inspection in development

The Vite plugin adds source locations to your development output. The inspector lives in an isolated Shadow DOM surface and stays out of the production build.

## Give your coding agent the same context

Capture the element's source context into the local handoff queue. A configured MCP client can retrieve the captured record through the local daemon, so you can work from a concrete source location instead of retyping what you saw.
