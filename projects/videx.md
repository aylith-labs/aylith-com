name: Videx
tagline: Turn any video library into a domain-tailored knowledge base
description: >-
  Videx indexes YouTube channels and their full transcripts, then adapts its
  search, summaries and topic discovery to the domain you pick — AI engineering,
  data science, system design, security, creative tech, or anything at all.
category: developer-tools
features:
  - Pick a knowledge domain and the whole app retunes to it
  - Channel and video transcript ingestion with chapter and metadata extraction
  - Full-text plus pgvector semantic search across every transcript
  - 'AI summaries, topics and extraction over a pluggable provider chain'
  - 'Chat grounded in a video''s transcript, answers cited back to timestamps'
  - YouTube OAuth sync for personal playlists and video groups
targetUser: >-
  Developers and researchers who learn from video and need it searchable,
  quotable and organised around the field they actually work in.

## Vision

### Access and setup

Videx is in a private repository, not a public self-service service. Its local development addresses do not provide application access to visitors. Authorized installation prerequisites and unresolved setup gaps are listed above; no waitlist or automatic access grant is implied.

The best technical talks, deep dives and frontier lectures are on YouTube, and video is the worst
medium there is for finding a specific idea again. Videx turns a library of channels into an index
you can search, quote and interrogate — and it shapes itself around the field you are studying
rather than assuming everyone is here for the same thing.

## The problem

Video knowledge sits in unsearchable timelines, spread across creators who never agreed on
vocabulary. A single generic search box treats a shader tutorial and a distributed-consensus talk
the same way, so the queries that would surface the right moment never get suggested and the
summaries never use the right words.

## How it works

- **Domain personalization** — choose AI Engineering, Data Science, System Design, Cybersecurity,
  Creative Tech, or the universal profile. Suggested queries, focus topics, channel discovery and
  AI prompts all retune, and switching is instant.
- **Transcript-first ingestion** — channel listings via InnerTube, captions, chapters and engagement
  metadata, stored as timestamped segments rather than one flat blob.
- **Hybrid search** — PostgreSQL full-text for the exact phrase, pgvector embeddings for the idea
  you can only describe.
- **Grounded chat** — transcript context and timestamp citations support answers; citation accuracy still needs review.
- **Provider-agnostic AI** — a configurable provider chain; features can be unavailable when access or providers fail.
